:sectnums:
:toc:

== Background

People often struggle to maintain consistent habits due to a lack of motivation or visible progress. This app leverages gamification principles, such as rewards and streaks, to encourage users to stick to their habits. The lightweight design ensures quick onboarding and usability.

== Requirements

The app will allow users to track their habits, monitor their progress, and stay motivated through gamification.

- **Must Have**:
  - Create, edit, and delete habits.
  - Daily habit tracking with a streak system.
  - Gamified elements: badges, levels, and rewards.
  - Progress visualization (charts for habit completion).
  - Notifications/reminders for habits.

- **Should Have**:
  - Ability to group habits (e.g., health, productivity).
  - Cloud sync for multiple devices.
  - Offline functionality.

- **Could Have**:
  - Social sharing of progress and badges.
  - Habit suggestions based on user goals.

- **Won't Have**:
  - Full-fledged social networking features.
  - AI-based habit tracking in the MVP.

== Method

The app will be developed using a modular architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability. Key components include:
